Introducing the libCellML project
---------------------------------
The libCellML project aims to provide a library for working with CellML, focussed on CellML 1.2, but with limited support for older formats (i.e. CellML 1.0 and 1.1). 

The motivation for the libCellML project
----------------------------------------

A fresh start at creating core software support for tool developers that would like to make use of the CellML standard in their tools. LibCellML will be implemented in a manner that makes it easier and more natural to work with than the `previous CellML API project <cellml-api.sf.net>`. Some further information is available in the :ref: libcellmlRoadmap `libCellML roadmap`.

Status of CellML 1.2
--------------------
There is not yet a document that represents CellML 1.2 will differ from the previous version.  However, the following are good sources for indicating what CellML 1.2 might look like:

#. Starting point `document <https://cellml-specification.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>` for editorial board working draft. This currently describes CellML 1.1 minus reactions.  The aim is to incrementally edit this with version history mapping to the relevant tracker items so that a good provenance record is available.
#. `An e-mail <https://lists.cellml.org/sympa/arc/cellml-discussion/2012-10/msg00005.html>` reporting on the planning for CellML 1.2 at the 2012 CellML workshop
#. `A rendering of one proposal <codecurve.github.io/cellml-core-spec/>` from previous work towards a draft of CellML 1.2 that was done before the editorial board process was in place.  Note however that this assumes the use of MathML 3.  The editorial board plans to use some of the text from this draft.


Expected availability
---------------------
At this stage, it has been decided to undertake the libCellML project based on rough time estimates only, hence there is very little certainty yet as to when the first versions that are practically useful will be available.  The libCellML project will aim to deliver some functionality as early as possible.  An iterative development methodology will aim to provide updated versions with additional functionality regularly.  Again, please see the :ref: libcellmlRoadmap `roadmap document`.
