libCellML Developer Documentation
=================================

This section of documentation is intended for developers.  libCellML uses Git for source code management (SCM), Buildbot for continuous integration testing and Github to host the software on the web.  The way in which these elements are brought together and how a developer is expected to use them forms the development process which is defined here.

The repository at https://github.com/cellml/libcellml is the definitive repository for the software and used for creating software releases.  We will refer to this repository as the **prime** repository.  The developer documentation describes the Git branching model in use on the **prime** repository and the process to follow for getting new code added to this repository.  The process is designed to be as standard as possible.
